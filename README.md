===========================

Angular JS templates for Eclipse or SpringToolSuite.   Used with STS 3.1.0 on Eclipse 3.8.1


This repository contains HTML and JS Templates [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) to be used with [SpringToolSuite](http://www.springsource.org/sts) or [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) upon which STS is based.

Templates are a set of abbreviations that expand in to 'code snippets' for common tasks such as creating variables and functions. These abbreviations significantly speed up development and reduce coding errors.


I watched several videos by [John Lindquist](http://www.youtube.com/user/johnlindquist) on using Angular.   Similar LiveEditing functionality
can be accomplished using Yeoman (recommended by the AngularJS guys and others) which also offers other benefits.

After some googling, I found this post by googling Angular Templates
